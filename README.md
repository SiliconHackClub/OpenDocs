Building the Ultimate Developer Documentation Hub


# OpenDocs – Developer Documentation Hub

Welcome to **OpenDocs**, an open-source initiative by [Silicon Hack Club](https://siliconhackclub.xyz).  
Our mission is to create a **comprehensive, beginner-friendly, and community-driven documentation hub** for developers around the world.  

Whether you are learning your first programming language, exploring DevOps, or diving into AI/ML, this repository is here to help. All content is written in **Markdown (.md)** and published on our [website](https://siliconhackclub.xyz).
